Repo for SoftDes Spring 2016 MP #4: Interactive Programming
Authors: Coleman Ellis and Kaitlyn Keil

Required packages: PyGame, PygButton

If PyGame and PygButton are installed and working, running InteractiveProgramming.py should bring up a PyGame window with our model in it.

Press the buttons to see plots of different numbers; the lines represent adjacent digits. For example, when pi is displayed, there's a line between 3 and 1, between 1 and 4, between 4 and 1, etc.
